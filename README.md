# Air-Quality-Classification
The project applies machine learning techniques to classify air quality levels using environmental data into Good, Moderate, Poor and Hazardous categories. Random Forest SVM, KNN, GBC and XGBoost models are implemented. It incorporates data preparation followed by adjustment stages together with model performance testing processes.
